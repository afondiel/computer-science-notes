## Introduction
### What's DevOps?
- DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.
- DevOps emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation.
- DevOps aligns development and operations to optimize quality and delivery.

### Applications
- DevOps can help teams deliver value to their users faster using proven agile tools to plan, track, and discuss work across their teams.
- DevOps can help teams build, test, and deploy with CI/CD(Continue Integration/ Continue Deployement) that works with any language, platform, and cloud.
- DevOps can help teams develop securely from inception to ship with application security testing services.

## Fundamentals
### How DevOps works?
- DevOps teams include developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment.
- DevOps teams adopt agile practices to improve speed and quality, breaking work into smaller pieces to deliver incremental value.
- DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, which helps to increase reliability.
- DevOps teams use the infinity loop to show how the phases of the DevOps lifecycle relate to each other, symbolizing the need for constant collaboration and iterative improvementÂ¹.
