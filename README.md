## Overview

As a Software Engineer Consultant, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of topics in the **automotive** and **agriculture** industries, including electrification and sustainability, safety and comfort, and more.

So, I decided to compile some resources from previous experiences and projects in order to create a sort of [Whole Computer Science Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog) for Software Engineers, Developers and CS Students diving into the field.

## Key Features
- Access the notebook anywhere, online or offline.
- Use it as a knowledge base for software engineering concepts and practices.
- Refresh your memory with the notebook's quick overviews.
- Prepare for job interviews with the notebook's comprehensive guidance.
- Review your CS foundations with the notebook's structured approach.
- Stay updated on the latest software engineering trends.


## Key Benefits
- **Accelerate Your Learning**: Use concise and short notes curated by passionate software engineers, to boost your productivity.
- **Wide-Ranging Resources**: From algorithms to data structures, design patterns to coding best practices, the notebook covers it all.
- **Interactive Learning**: Discover engaging code examples, real-world applications, and interactive challenges to solidify your understanding.
- **Community-Driven**: The notebook is maintained by a vibrant community of developers like yourself, all working together to shape the future to make CS resources accessible to all.


## Topics & Industries

You will find a variety of topics accross software development cycle including requirements, design, programming languages, and testing. You will also find research papers and notebooks about AI, [Prompt Engineering & LLMs](https://github.com/afondiel/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-DeepLearningAI), ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics, and more.

## Usage

If you'd like to read the notes online, you can visit https://afondiel.github.io/computer-science-open-catalog/.

If you'd like to read it locally, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afondiel/computer-science-open-catalog
cd computer-science-open-catalog
cargo install mdbook
mdbook build
mdbook serve
```

Happy learning & Enjoy your readings!

`Some to-do tasks:`

- Add guidelines of "essential resources to get into a specific industry/company"
- Add more industries notes: Telecommunications & Network, Aerospace, Defense, Naval-Maritime ...
- Create a pipeline to generate a 'minimum' note content using [hello_world_prompt.md](./hello_world_prompt.md) + [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) / [Bard API ](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/AI-ML/Google-Bard-API/m-p/538517#M1526)
