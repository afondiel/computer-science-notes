## Overview

As a Software Engineer Consultant, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of topics in the **automotive** and **agriculture** industries, including electrification and sustainability, safety and comfort, and more.

So, I decided to compile some resources from my previous and ongoing work that software engineers looking to get into any tech industry might find useful, including core skills, projects, and tools.

## Motivation

The big picture behind this project is to create a "Hello World" Notebook, sort of [Whole "Software Engineering" Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog), that Software Engineers, Developers and Computer Science Students can use as an aide-memoire or a "prompt" for their daily work, interview preps and study checklist, etc.

## Why Use This Notebook?

- üöÄ Accelerate Your Learning: Dive into a treasure trove of knowledge curated by passionate software engineers for fellow developers.
- üì¶ Wide-Ranging Resources: From algorithms to data structures, design patterns to coding best practices, our notebook covers it all.
- üìù Interactive Learning: Discover engaging code examples, real-world applications, and interactive challenges to solidify your understanding.
- üåê Community-Driven: Join a vibrant community of developers like yourself, all working together to shape the future of this invaluable resource.


## Topics 

Topics covered include requirements, design, programming languages, and testing. You may also find some research papers and notebooks about AI, [Prompt Engineering & LLMs](https://github.com/afondiel/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-DeepLearningAI), ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics, and more.

## Note & Content Generation

**Generate template files and folders with [hello_world.py](hello_world.py) tool**. 

The tool generate the note structure in 3 steps:

1. create a note template 

```python
def note_content_template(topic):
    pass
```
2. Then creates the repos `docs` & `lab` 

```python
def create_repo(repo_name):
    pass
```
3. Finally, it generates the entire template files

```python
def note_gen(topic_name):
    pass
```
**Usage**
```
Usage: python hello_world.py [options] [<NotePath>] [<NoteName>]

[<NotePath>]
        Specify a path if you want to generate the note in a different location
[<NoteName>]
        Note/Topic name
Options:
        -v, --verbose: print debug informationn
        -a, --all: display the list of current notes
        -h, --help: see usage
```

Try it out! by running the command below. Choose a `topic`, and create your first note:

```python
python hello_world.py topic-name
```

output:

```
E:.
‚îÇ   topic-notes.md
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄdocs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄlab
```

**ChatGPT/Bard Prompt for Content Generation**

After generating your first (empty) note you can fill it out the content by using the prompt below (if you're using Copilot, It might do trick as well)

```
I'm going to train you write to a short-form summarization.

The summarization has the following format: 
`
# {Topic} - Notes
## Table of Contents (ToC)
## Overview
## Applications
## Tools & Frameworks
## Hello World!
## References
`
Here are the rules: 
- The `##Overview` heading has to be one line sentence
- Organize the following headings in a list of 5-6 succinct bullets 
- Do not use hashtags and emojis. Ever.
- The `## Hello World! ` has to be a code
- replace `{Topic}` by the topic name 

I am going to give you a topic and you will summarize the topic, and output the summarization in markdown format.

Do you understand?

```

Transition:

```
Topic={Topic}
``` 

The final output should be a something like [this](#)!

Notice: this prompt might not work in the attempt depending on the what AI chat you're using. Just hit `regenerate` to the LLM the time to "think" if that the case
