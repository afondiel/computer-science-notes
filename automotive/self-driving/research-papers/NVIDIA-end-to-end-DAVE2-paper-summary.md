# NVIDIA End-to-End DAVE2 paper Summary 


**Introduction**

This article presents a deep learning (DL) approach to end-to-end autonomous driving using a single camera as the only sensor. The proposed approach trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly map raw camera images to steering commands, without the need for any intermediate processing steps such as feature extraction or lane detection.

**Problem and Methodologies**

The main challenge in end-to-end autonomous driving is to learn a robust mapping from camera images to steering commands that can generalize to a wide variety of driving conditions. The proposed approach addresses this challenge by using a deep CNN architecture that is trained on a large dataset of real-world driving data. The CNN is trained to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual steering angles.

**Architecture pipeline**

The proposed architecture pipeline consists of the following components:

1. A camera that captures images of the road ahead.
2. A CNN that maps the camera images to steering commands.
3. A controller that implements the steering commands.

**Findings**

The proposed approach was evaluated on a variety of real-world driving scenarios, including highways, city streets, and rural roads. The results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve safe and reliable autonomous driving in a variety of driving conditions.

**Conclusion**

The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of using a deep learning approach to end-to-end autonomous driving using a single camera as the only sensor. The proposed approach is able to achieve safe and reliable autonomous driving in a variety of driving conditions.
