## Introduction

`Large Vision Models (LVMs)` are deep learning models designed to handle large-scale visual tasks by leveraging extensive data and advanced architectures.

### What's Large Vision Models (LVMs)?
- High-capacity models trained on vast visual datasets.
- Designed to perform complex vision tasks with high accuracy.
- Examples include Vision Transformers (ViTs) and large-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

### Key Concepts and Terminology
- **Scale**: Refers to the massive amount of data and parameters used in LVMs.
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A model that uses transformer architecture for image tasks.
- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: LVMs are often pre-trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned for specific tasks.

### Applications
- Image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- Autonomous driving, medical imaging, and surveillance.
- Generative tasks like image synthesis and style transfer.

## Fundamentals

### LVM Architecture Pipeline
- Data Collection and Preprocessing at scale.
- Core model architecture: Vision Transformers, CNNs, or hybrid models.
- Training pipeline: Pre-training on large datasets followed by fine-tuning.

### How LVMs Work?
- Utilize massive datasets (e.g., ImageNet, JFT-300M) for pre-training.
- Leverage attention mechanisms (in ViTs) or deep convolutional layers (in CNNs).
- Transfer learning is applied to adapt the model for specific downstream tasks.

### Types of LVMs

- **Vision Transformers (ViTs):**
  - Uses self-attention mechanisms to process images.
  - Scales well with larger datasets and model sizes.
  - Excels in image classification tasks.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
  - Deep hierarchical models that use convolutional layers to extract features.
  - Popular for tasks like image classification, detection, and segmentation.
  - Examples include ResNet, Inception, and EfficientNet.

- **Hybrid Models:**
  - Combines CNNs with transformers to leverage the strengths of both architectures.
  - Example: Swin Transformer, which integrates CNN-like patch processing with attention mechanisms.
  - Useful for tasks requiring both fine-grained and contextual understanding.

### Some Hands-on Examples
- Image classification using a pre-trained Vision Transformer.
- Fine-tuning a large CNN on a custom dataset.
- Applying LVMs for object detection in autonomous driving datasets.

## Tools & Frameworks
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for implementing LVMs.
- Hugging Face Transformers for Vision Transformers.
- Google’s TPU and NVIDIA’s GPU for large-scale training.

## Hello World!

```python
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification
from PIL import Image
import requests

model_name = "google/vit-base-patch16-224"
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits

# Print the predicted class
predicted_class = logits.argmax(-1).item()
print("Predicted class:", predicted_class)
```
