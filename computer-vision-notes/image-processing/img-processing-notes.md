# Image Processing (DIP) - Notes


## Overview

Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm.

## Applications 

- Classification
- Feature extraction
- Multi-scale signal analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Projection


## Basics

- Image : a 2D matrix (m x n , array of pixels) 
  - types of images : 
    - RGB(Red Green Blue - original colored image) : 3D (dim (W x H x L))  => 3 channels
    - GrayScale (Gradient) : 2D (dim(W x H)) => 1 channel
- PIXEL (Picture ELement): it is the smallest element of a digital image (2D)
  - light intensity of some location in the img 
- VOXEL (Volumic PIXEL): pixel of a 3D image
  
GrayScale image (GS) : is one in which each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light. GS are composed exclusively of shades of gray, with the contrast ranging from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest
.
- Edge : rapid change in brightness/intensity
- Edge Detection : identifying sharp changes in intensity in adjacent(neighboring) pixels

        0 ---------> 255
        where : 
            0 : Black 
            255 : White 

- Gradient : measure of change in brightness/intensity over adjacent pixels 
  - strong gradient (0 - 255)
  - small gradient (0 - 15 ...)

- Histogram: it is the distribution (frequency) of grayscale (GS) of an image

- **Region of ​​interest(ROI)**: a portion of an image that you want to filter or perform some other operation on
- **Segmentation**: operation which consists of extracting geometric primitives from an image.
    - The most used primitives:
        - Segments (outlines)
        - Surfaces( regions)
        - classification or thresholding
- **Calibration**: operation which consists in finding the relation between the coordinates in the image and the coordinates in the space of the scene.
- **Filter**: takes an input image and produces a (cleaner) output image
- **LUT(Lool Up Table)**: conversion table that groups neighboring NG pixels into a single value.
    - Matrix with different pixel values
    - By doing operations on the LUTs it allows to process the image
- **Recale**: geometric transformation technique allowing to go from a source image to a target image (destination)

- **Morphological**:
  - Skeleton
  - Erosion
  - Dilation
- **Frequency**
  - Frame
  - Equalize
  - Opening(object)
  - Closure(hole)
  - Filter(freq)
- **Operators**:
  - img(src) -> Img(destination)
  - img (src) -> information set
  - information set -> img(destination)
