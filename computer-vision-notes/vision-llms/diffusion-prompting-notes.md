## Introduction
### What's stable diffusion prompting?
Stable diffusion prompting is a technique for generating realistic and diverse images from text descriptions using a deep neural network model called Stable Diffusion¹.

### Applications
Stable diffusion prompting can be used for various creative and artistic purposes, such as:
- Generating portraits, landscapes, animals, and other scenes from keywords or sentences
- Creating stylized images with different mediums, styles, and effects
- Enhancing or modifying existing images with negative prompts
- Exploring novel and unexpected combinations of concepts and attributes

## Fundamentals
### How stable diffusion prompting works?
#### Stable Diffusion Architecture Pipeline

Stable diffusion prompting works by using a text encoder and an image decoder in a pipeline. 

The text encoder converts the text prompt into a vector representation, called an embedding, that captures the semantic meaning of the text. 

The image decoder takes the embedding as an input and generates an image that matches the text prompt. 

The image decoder is based on a stable diffusion model, which is a type of generative model that can produce high-quality and diverse images by gradually adding details and noise to a random initial image³.

## Tools & Frameworks
There are several tools and frameworks that can be used to perform stable diffusion prompting, such as:
- Stable Diffusion Art: A web-based platform that allows users to generate images from text prompts using various models and settings⁴
- How-To Geek: A website that provides tutorials and tips on how to write effective and awesome prompts for Stable Diffusion⁵
- Generative Labs: A blog that covers topics related to generative art and AI, including prompt syntax and FAQ for Stable Diffusion
- Mockey: A tool that helps users create and share mockups and prototypes using Stable Diffusion
- AI Writing Hacks: A website that offers a step-by-step guide on how to write Stable Diffusion prompts, with examples and best practices

## Hello World!
Here is a simple example of how to generate an image from a text prompt using Stable Diffusion Art:

## Lab: Zero to Hero Projects
To practice and improve your stable diffusion prompting skills, you can try some of these projects:
- Generate a self-portrait or a portrait of someone you admire using Stable Diffusion
- Create a logo or a banner for your website or business using Stable Diffusion
- Make a collage or a poster of your favorite movies, books, or games using Stable Diffusion
- Design a cover or a illustration for a story or a song using Stable Diffusion
- Invent a new creature or a character using Stable Diffusion
