## Introduction
Machine Vision involves the use of imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for various applications, typically in industrial settings.

### What's Machine Vision?
- A technology that uses imaging devices and software to perform automated visual inspections and analyses.
- Commonly applied in manufacturing, quality control, and robotics.
- Integrates hardware like cameras and sensors with software algorithms to interpret visual data.

### Key Concepts and Terminology
- **Image Processing**: Techniques to enhance, segment, and analyze images for machine interpretation.
- **Camera Calibration**: Adjusting camera parameters to ensure accurate image capture.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in images, crucial for object detection and classification.
- **3D Vision**: Techniques that enable machines to understand depth and three-dimensional structures.

### Applications
- Quality control in manufacturing processes.
- Automated inspection and sorting systems.
- Robotics for object recognition and navigation.
- Surveillance and security systems.

## Fundamentals

### Machine Vision Architecture Pipeline
- **Image Acquisition**: Capturing images using cameras, sensors, and lighting systems.
- **Preprocessing**: Enhancing images, correcting distortions, and filtering noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying important details within an image (e.g., edges, textures).
- **Object Detection and Classification**: Identifying and categorizing objects within the image.
- **Decision Making**: Using analyzed data to make automated decisions, such as pass/fail in quality inspection.

### How Machine Vision Works
- **Step 1**: Capturing images through a calibrated camera system under controlled lighting conditions.
- **Step 2**: Preprocessing images to enhance key features and reduce noise.
- **Step 3**: Using algorithms like edge detection and machine learning models to analyze images.
- **Step 4**: Making decisions based on the visual data, such as triggering a robotic arm or sorting products.

### Types of Machine Vision Systems
- **2D Vision Systems**:
  - Analyzes flat images for tasks like barcode scanning and label verification.
  - Common in simple inspection tasks.

- **3D Vision Systems**:
  - Provides depth information, used in complex applications like robot guidance and 3D object reconstruction.
  - Utilizes techniques like stereo vision, laser triangulation, and time-of-flight.

- **Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imaging**:
  - Captures images across various wavelengths to analyze material properties.
  - Used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and food quality inspection.

### Some Hands-on Examples
- Implementing a basic object detection system using a 2D vision setup.
- Developing a 3D vision system for robotic arm guidance.
- Creating a quality inspection system for detecting defects on a production line.

## Tools & Frameworks
- **OpenCV**: Open-source library for computer vision tasks, widely used for image processing.
- **MATLAB**: Provides extensive tools for image processing and machine vision system design.
- **Halcon**: A software library designed for machine vision applications, including high-level algorithms.
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch**: Frameworks for implementing machine learning models in vision systems.

## Hello World!

```python
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('sample_image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(gray_image, threshold1=50, threshold2=150)

# Display the results
cv2.imshow('Edges', edges)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
