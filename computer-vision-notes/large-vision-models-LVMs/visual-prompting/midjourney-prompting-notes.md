## Introduction
### What's midjourney prompting?
Midjourney prompting is a technique for generating realistic and diverse images from text descriptions using a deep neural network model called **Midjourney**.

### Applications
Midjourney prompting can be used for various creative and artistic purposes, such as:
- Generating portraits, landscapes, animals, and other scenes from keywords or phrases
- Creating stylized images with different mediums, styles, and effects
- Enhancing or modifying existing images with image URLs or parameters
- Exploring novel and unexpected combinations of concepts and attributes

## Fundamentals
### How midjourney prompting works?
#### Midjourney Architecture Pipeline

Midjourney prompting works by using a text encoder and an image decoder in a pipeline. 

- The text encoder converts the text prompt into a vector representation, called an embedding, that captures the semantic meaning of the text. 

- The image decoder takes the embedding as an input and generates an image that matches the text prompt. 

- The image decoder is based on a Midjourney model, which is a type of generative model that can produce high-quality and diverse images by learning from a large dataset of imagesÂ³.

## Tools & Frameworks
There are several tools and frameworks that can be used to perform midjourney prompting, such as:
- Midjourney Art: A web-based platform that allows users to generate images from text prompts using various models and settings
- Midjourney Docs: A website that provides tutorials and tips on how to write effective and awesome prompts for Midjourney
- Midjourney v6: A blog that covers topics related to generative art and AI, including prompt syntax and FAQ for Midjourney
- Mockey: A tool that helps users create and share mockups and prototypes using Midjourney
- AI Writing Hacks: A website that offers a step-by-step guide on how to write Midjourney prompts, with examples and best practices

## Hello World!
Here is a simple example of how to generate an image from a text prompt using Midjourney Art:

## Lab: Zero to Hero Projects
To practice and improve your midjourney prompting skills, you can try some of these projects:
- Generate a self-portrait or a portrait of someone you admire using Midjourney
- Create a logo or a banner for your website or business using Midjourney
- Make a collage or a poster of your favorite movies, books, or games using Midjourney
- Design a cover or a illustration for a story or a song using Midjourney
- Invent a new creature or a character using Midjourney
