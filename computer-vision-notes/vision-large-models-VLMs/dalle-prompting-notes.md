## Introduction
DALL-E prompting is the art of creating text descriptions that can generate novel and high-quality images using the DALL-E model.

## Fundamentals
- DALL-E is a neural network that can create images from text prompts, using a large-scale dataset of text-image pairs.
- DALL-E can generate images of various styles, backgrounds, camera angles, and compositions, depending on the prompt.
- DALL-E can also perform outpainting, which is the ability to extend the image beyond the original boundaries.

## Tools & Frameworks
- DALL-E is available as a web service from OpenAI, which allows users to experiment with different prompts and see the results.
- Microsoft Designer is a graphic design app that integrates DALL-E as an image creator, which lets users generate complete designs from prompts.
- Better Input is a website that provides tips and examples for improving DALL-E prompts.

## Hello World!
Here is a simple example of how to generate an image with DALL-E:

```text
a cat wearing a hat and sunglasses
```

## Lab: Zero to Hero Projects
Here are some projects that you can try to master DALL-E prompting:

- Create a logo for your own brand or company using DALL-E.
- Generate a comic strip or a storyboard with DALL-E, using dialogue and captions.
- Make a collage or a mosaic with DALL-E, using multiple prompts and images.
- Design a poster or a flyer for an event or a cause with DALL-E.
- Invent a new character or a creature with DALL-E, using attributes and features.
