# Statistics Notes

## Overview

The discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.

## Two types of statistics
- **Descriptive statistics:** focus mainly on Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): data collection + graphical representation (ex: hystogram) 
- **Inferential statistics:** the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability

## The (Descriptive) statistics Series
- Series of positions: average, median, extended, quartile 
- Series of dispersions: variance, Standard deviation

## Applications

- Statistics helps in providing a better understanding and accurate description of natureâ€™s phenomena.
- Statistics helps in the proper and efficient planning of a statistical inquiry in any field of study.
- Statistics helps in collecting appropriate quantitative data.
- Statistics helps in presenting complex data in a suitable tabular, diagrammatic and graphic form for an easy and clear comprehension of the data.
- Statistics helps in understanding the nature and pattern of variability of a phenomenon through quantitative observations.
- Statistics helps in drawing valid inferences, along with a measure of their reliability about the population parameters from the sample data.
