# Embedded Systems - Notes

## Overview

An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.


## Applications

- Robotics
- Automotive
- Telecommunications
- Electronic devices (Smart-phone, washing machines ...)

## Tools and Frameworks

- Dev boards: 
  - Arduino
  - Raspberry Pi
  - uChip
  - STM32
  - ...

## Embedded Sw Engineer Roadmap 

**1. Master C Programming language**

- Learn C & master IT!
  - Pointers & adresses
  - Multithreading
  - Data Structures
    - Sorting & Filtering
    - LIFO/FIFO
    - Embedded protobuf
- SW Optimization : peformance, power efficiency, cpu loads...

- More advanced programming languages 
  - C++/Python (later)
  - Rust/embedded rust
  - Machine learning 
  - Tiny ML

**2. Project Mindset**

- Working on Enjoyable project
- Challenge them
  
**3. Key skills to Master**

After the C/C++, learn Embedded Software Programming  

- What Skills to Focus on? 

  - Super loop/ while (1)/real time main loop
  - GPIOS
  - DAC/DAC
  - INTERRUPTS
  - HW Communication protocols
  	- SPI/QSPI
  	- I2C
  	- UART/USART
  	- BLUETOOTH
  	- USB
  	- ETHERNET
    - DMA : Direct Memory Access

  - **MEMORY Management**
    - How Flashs : Reads/Writes data
    - ROM
    - RAM + NVRoll/NVFix 
  - **Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**
    - Multithreadings
    - semaphore
    - threads

- Other Important skills 

  - How to Read Documentation
  - Different Types of Embedded Software Engineers 
  - Keep Practicing and Learning 
  - IMPORTANT Soft Skills (good communication ...)
