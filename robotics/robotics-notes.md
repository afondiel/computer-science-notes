## What's Robotics?

Interdisciplinary branch of engineering and computer science. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots.

## What Robots do?

- Work in extreme environments too dangerous for people : 
	- war or nuclear zones
	- sub-sea areas
	- outre space
	- Drones
- Help around the home : 
	- mops
	- vacuum cleaners
	behalf work along side human 
- Control autonomous cars : 
	- Waymo
	- tesla
- Read and learn
	- Marge (university of Oxiford)
	- ELIZA
- Healthcare : 
	- human desibility assitance (help users with limited arms/legs do)
	- ASIMOV
	..

## Types of Robots

- Mobile : 
  - AMRs  
  - AGVs

>**"The 3 of Robotics" by the Great Isaac Asimov**
>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
>2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
