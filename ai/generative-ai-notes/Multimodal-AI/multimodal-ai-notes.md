## Introduction
Multimodal AI integrates multiple types of data inputs to produce more complex outputs.

## Key Concepts and Terminology
- **Multimodality**: Integration of various data types like text, images, and audio.
- **Data Fusion**: Combining data from different sources to improve decision-making.
- **Generative AI**: AI that can generate new content based on learned data.

## Applications
- Enhanced user interfaces with voice, text, and visual inputs.
- Advanced analytics combining numerical data, text, and images.
- Improved accessibility features for differently-abled individuals.

## Fundamentals
- Multimodal AI relies on the combination of unimodal AI models.
- It uses neural networks to process and integrate diverse data types.
- The goal is to create AI that can understand context like humans do.

## Multimodal AI Architecture Pipeline
- Input Processing: Handles various data types.
- Fusion Layer: Integrates inputs into a unified representation.
- Output Generation: Produces outputs that may include multiple data types.

## How Multimodal AI works?
- Processes inputs through specialized sub-models for each data type.
- Employs techniques like embedding and vectorization for data representation.
- Utilizes deep learning to correlate and combine inputs into coherent outputs.

## Some hands-on examples
- Creating chatbots that understand text and images.
- Developing systems that interpret emotions from voice and facial expressions.
- Implementing AI that can generate descriptive text from videos.

## Tools & Frameworks
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for building neural network models.
- OpenAI's GPT-3 for text processing and generation.
- Google's BERT for understanding context in text.

## Hello World!

```python
# Simple Multimodal AI example using text and image inputs
def multimodal_hello_world(text_input, image_input):
    # Process text input
    text_output = text_model.process(text_input)
    # Process image input
    image_output = image_model.process(image_input)
    # Combine outputs
    return text_output + image_output

print(multimodal_hello_world("Hello, world!", image_data))
```

## Lab: Zero to Hero Projects
- Build a multimodal sentiment analysis tool.
- Create a visual question answering system.
- Develop a cross-modal retrieval application.
