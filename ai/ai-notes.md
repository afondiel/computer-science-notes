## Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligience demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the human intelligence.

**AI Capabilities**

- **See**: perceive their environment through vision or other senses
- **Talk**: hold a natural language dialog grounded in their environment
- **Act**: navigate and interact with their environment to accomplish goals
- **Reason**: consider and plan for the long-term consequences of their actions

## Applications

- Transportation & Mobility: Self-driving cars
- Robotics: General Purpose Humanoid Robots
- Healthcare
- Strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
- Chat bots: ChatGPT, Bard, Grok ...   
- Advanced web search engines (Google, Bing..), 
- Recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), 
- Understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), 
- AI Art: Image generation ...
- ...

## Tools & Frameworks

- Large Language Models (LLMs): Openai GPT Models, Google PaLM, LAMDA, Meta LLama(s), ...
- Search algorithm
- Mathematical optimization 
- Evolutionary computation ...
