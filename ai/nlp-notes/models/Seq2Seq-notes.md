## Introduction
Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) is a deep learning model architecture designed to map input sequences to output sequences.

### What's Seq2Seq?
- Introduced for tasks like machine translation and summarization.
- Uses an encoder-decoder structure to process sequences of varying lengths.
- Capable of handling sequential data such as text, speech, and time series.

### Key Concepts and Terminology
- **Encoder**: Converts the input sequence into a fixed-length context vector.
- **Decoder**: Generates the output sequence from the context vector.
- **Context Vector**: A summary of the input sequence used by the decoder.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enhances Seq2Seq models by allowing the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input.

### Applications
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.
- **Text Summarization**: Condensing long texts into shorter versions.
- **Chatbots**: Generating conversational responses.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text.

## Fundamentals

### Seq2Seq Architecture Pipeline
- **Input Sequence**: Tokenized text or other sequential data.
- **Encoder**: Processes input sequence into a hidden state or context vector.
- **Context Vector**: Intermediate representation passed to the decoder.
- **Decoder**: Uses the context vector to generate the output sequence.
- **Output Sequence**: The final generated sequence (e.g., translated text).

### How Seq2Seq Works
- **Encoding**: The encoder processes each token of the input sequence and produces a fixed-size context vector.
- **Decoding**: The decoder takes the context vector and generates the output sequence one token at a time.
- **Training**: Typically involves teacher forcing, where the correct output is fed into the decoder during training.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input at each step of the output generation.

### Types of Seq2Seq Models
- **Vanilla Seq2Seq**: Basic model with a single encoder and decoder.
- **Attention-Based Seq2Seq**: Incorporates attention to improve performance.
- **Bidirectional Encoder**: Uses information from both past and future tokens.
- **Transformer-Based Seq2Seq**: Applies the transformer architecture for more efficient sequence processing.

### Some Hands-On Examples
- **Machine Translation**: Building an English-to-French translator.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizing news articles.
- **Chatbot Development**: Creating a Seq2Seq-based conversational agent.
- **Speech to Text**: Implementing Seq2Seq for transcribing spoken language.

## Tools & Frameworks
- **TensorFlow Seq2Seq**: A toolkit for building Seq2Seq models with TensorFlow.
- **Fairseq**: Facebook's sequence-to-sequence modeling toolkit.
- **OpenNMT**: Open-source neural machine translation framework.
- **Hugging Face**: Supports transformer-based Seq2Seq models like T5 and BART.

## Hello World!
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense, Embedding

# Example Seq2Seq model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=64),
    SimpleRNN(128, return_sequences=True),
    SimpleRNN(128),
    Dense(10000, activation='softmax')
])

# Example input and prediction
input_seq = tf.random.uniform((1, 10))
output_seq = model(input_seq)
print(output_seq)
```
