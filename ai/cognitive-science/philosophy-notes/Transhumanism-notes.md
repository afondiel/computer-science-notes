## 1. **Introduction**  
**Transhumanism** is a movement and philosophical ideology focused on enhancing human abilities and extending lifespan through advanced technologies, such as AI, genetic engineering, and biotechnology. 

- **Key focus**: Improving physical, mental, and emotional capacities beyond current biological limits.
- **Relevance**: Has implications for fields like medicine, AI, ethics, and society.
- **Impact**: Learning about transhumanism provides insight into how future technological advancements may transform human life, ethics, and society.

---

## 2. **Key Concepts and Terminology**  
- **Transhumanism**: The belief in using technology to enhance human capabilities.
- **Posthuman**: A theoretical being whose abilities go beyond those of present humans.
- **Human Augmentation**: Technologies or processes used to enhance human physical or cognitive abilities.
- **Longevity**: The concept of extending human life span through medical or technological means.
- **Singularity**: A theoretical future point where technological growth becomes uncontrollable, fundamentally changing society.

---

## 3. **Functional Overview**  
Transhumanism operates at the intersection of technology, ethics, and human evolution, proposing the use of emerging technologies to transcend biological limitations.

- **Core function**: Enhance human life through artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering.
- **Key structures**: Bioengineering, AI, cybernetics, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
- **Influence**: Plays a pivotal role in fields like healthcare (e.g., prosthetics), AI development, and ethics debates regarding human enhancement.
