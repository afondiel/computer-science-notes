## Types of sw testing
- Acceptance Testing (AT)
- System testing (ST)
- Integration Testing (IT) 
- Unit Testing (UT)

## How and when to write a sw testig plan?

Test plan is written during/between requirement definition and the Design stage

## Tools & framework

- Polyspace: static code analysis
- Helix QAC : static code analysis


## Stardards

- MISRA: critical systems 
- CERT
- CWE and CWE Top 25
